# Timber Framing Generator Technical Stack

## Overview

The Timber Framing Generator is a Python-based tool that automates the generation of timber framing elements for construction models. It integrates with Building Information Modeling (BIM) software like Revit through Rhino.Inside.Revit, providing a powerful bridge between architectural design and structural framing. The system extracts wall data, analyzes components and openings, and generates appropriate timber framing solutions through a combination of web services and direct CAD/BIM integration.
