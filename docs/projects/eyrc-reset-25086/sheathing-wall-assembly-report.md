## **1\. Sheathing Specifications**

### **Material Types**

* **Exterior Walls:** The Structural General Notes specify **Sure-Board Series 200 Sheathing** or **Flat Strap Bracing** (Sheet S0.01).  
* **Shear Walls:** Specifically noted to be sheathed with **Sure-Board Series 200 Sheathing** (Sheet S0.01).  
* **Roof Decking:** Specified as **Verco Type PLB-36** metal decking (Sheet S0.02, Metal Decking section).  
* **Pre-Fabricated Panels:** **Simpson Steel Strong-Wall** shear panels are also specified for lateral force resisting systems (Sheet S0.02).  
* **Vapor Barrier (Slab):** **Stego Wrap (15 mil)** vapor barrier or W.R. Meadows Premoulded Membrane is specified for under-slab applications (Sheet S0.01).

### **Fastening & Nailing Patterns**

* **Metal Decking:**  
  * Connect deck to steel supports at unit ends.  
  * Side laps connected by **1-1/2" top seam welds at 36" maximum o.c.** (Sheet S0.02).  
  * Attachment to steel supports: **5/8" puddle welds at 12" maximum o.c.** (Sheet S0.02).  
* **Cold-Formed Steel Connections:**  
  * General requirement for screw attachment, bolting, and anchoring (Sheet S0.02).  
  * Specific screw patterns for Sure-Board are referenced in the "Shear Wall Schedule" (See Section 4).

### **Edge Blocking**

* **Panel Edges:** Details indicate **Flat Strap Blocking** is required at horizontal panel edges for Sure-Board sheathed diaphragms (Sheet S1.23).  
* **Joists:** Block all joists at supports and under all partitions with full-depth blocking (Sheet S0.02).

## **2\. Wall Assembly Details**

### **Assembly Locations**

* **Architectural Assemblies:** The primary assembly compositions are located on **Sheet A2.10** under "Vertical Assembly Legend" and "Horizontal Assembly Legend".  
* **Structural Details:**  
  * **Sheet S1.21:** Contains "Typical Interior Metal Stud Full Height Wall Details" and header/jamb connection details.  
  * **Sheet S1.22:** Shows "Typical Stud Bracing with Sheathing" and "Typical Metal Stud Wall Corner" details.  
  * **Sheet S1.23:** Features "Typical Sureboard Shear Wall Elevation" and "Sure Board Sheathed Diaphragm" details.

### **Specific Assembly Notes**

* **Interior Partitions:**  
  * Non-bearing walls use metal studs (Sheet S1.21).  
  * Details show gypsum board attachment on both sides (implied by standard interior details on S1.21).  
* **Exterior/Shear Walls:**  
  * Details show Sure-Board sheathing applied to cold-formed steel studs (Sheet S1.23).

## **3\. General Notes about Sheathing**

### **Fire Rating**

* **Concrete:** Notes specify "Coordinate air content with required fire rating" (Sheet S0.01).  
* **Metal Deck:** Coordinate metal deck surface coatings with fire protection surface preparation requirements (Sheet S0.02).

### **Installation Requirements**

* **Surface Preparation:** All members shall be cut to be fitted and seated properly to abut.  
* **Fasteners:** Provide **Stainless Steel (AISI 316\)** fasteners for exterior use or when exposed to weather; Zinc-coated/Galvanized carbon steel anchors for other locations (Sheet S0.02).  
* **Steel Protection:** All members shall be given a coat of rust-resistant paint; field abrasions and welds must be touched up (Sheet S0.02).

### **Moisture Protection**

* **Vapor Barrier:** Stego Wrap (15 mil) installation must be in accordance with ASTM E1643-11 (Sheet S0.01).  
* **Deck Venting:** Metal deck shall be vented only where the deck will receive an impermeable roofing membrane (Sheet S0.02).

## **4\. Structural Sheathing Schedules**

*Note: The specific values (nail spacing, hold-down types) within the schedules are graphic-heavy and should be verified visually on the specific sheets listed below.*

### **Locations**

* **Shear Wall Schedule:** Located on **Sheet S2.01** (Foundation/Level 1 Framing Plan) and **Sheet S2.02** (Second Floor Framing Plan).  
* **Light Gauge Joist Schedule:** Located on **Sheet S2.02**.  
* **Diaphragm Schedule:** Referenced as part of the framing plans on **Sheet S2.02** and **Sheet S2.03**.

### **Panel Grade Requirements**

* **Sure-Board:** Series 200 is the specified structural panel grade (Sheet S0.01).  
* **Metal Deck:** Verco Type PLB-36 (Sheet S0.02).  
* **Cold-Formed Steel:**  
  * 18 Gauge and thinner: **ASTM A1003 Grade 33**.  
  * 16 Gauge and thicker: **Grade 50** (Sheet S0.02).
