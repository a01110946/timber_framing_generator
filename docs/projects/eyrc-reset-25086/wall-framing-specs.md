## Typical Light Gauge Stud Designations

### Gauge / Thickness Reference Table

| Min. Deliverable Thickness (MILS) | Gauge | Design Thickness (inches) |
|-----------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|
| 18 | 25 | .0188 |
| 27 | 22 | .0283 |

### SSMA Product ID Format

Example: **600 S 162 - 43**

- **600** = Overall Member Depth (in 1/100 in.) → 6.00"
- **S** = Style (S=Stud/Joist, T=Track, U=Channel, F=Furring Channel)
- **162** = Flange Width (in 1/100 in.) → 1.62"
- **43** = Material Thickness in mils (1/1000 in.) → 18 GA
