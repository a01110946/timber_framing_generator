PR TITLE: Add Supabase Database Integration

PR DESCRIPTION:
## Summary

This pull request integrates Supabase as the database for managing wall analysis jobs.  This replaces the in-memory storage previously used, enabling persistent job storage and retrieval.

## Changes

- Added Supabase client integration using the `supabase` Python library.
- Created a new `api/utils` directory containing database utility functions (`db.py`).
- Modified the `/api/endpoints/walls.py` endpoint to use Supabase for job creation, retrieval, updating, and listing.  The endpoint now supports listing jobs with optional filtering by status and pagination.
- Added a `.env.example` file for configuring Supabase URL and API keys.  Note: The `.env` file itself should *not* be committed to the repository.
- Created comprehensive unit tests (`test_supabase.py`) to verify the Supabase integration.
- Updated `requirements-api.txt` to include the `supabase` and `python-dotenv` packages.


## Testing

The Supabase integration has been thoroughly tested using unit tests which verify database connection, job creation, retrieval, updating, and listing functionalities.
