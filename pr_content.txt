PR TITLE: Add REST API for Timber Framing Generator

PR DESCRIPTION:
## Summary

This pull request introduces a REST API for the timber framing generator, enabling external applications to interact with the generator's functionality.  It includes a Docker configuration for easy deployment and uses FastAPI for the API framework.

## Changes

- Created a REST API using FastAPI.
- Implemented an endpoint for submitting wall data for analysis (`/walls/analyze`).
- Implemented an endpoint for retrieving analysis results (`/walls/{job_id}`).
- Added authentication using API keys.
- Added Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization.
- Created API models for input and output data using Pydantic.
- Implemented asynchronous task processing using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
- Added support for both Rhino integration (for actual geometry processing) and mock data for testing.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include API dependencies.
- Added `requirements-api.txt` for API specific dependencies.
- Added basic error handling and status reporting.
- Improved the Revit wall data extraction process.

## Testing

Added basic unit tests using pytest for the API.  Thorough testing of the Rhino integration will require separate integration tests.  The API includes a mock data option (`USE_RHINO` environment variable), allowing for testing without needing a running Rhino instance.
