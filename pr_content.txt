PR TITLE: Add Supabase Database Integration

PR DESCRIPTION:
## Summary

This pull request integrates Supabase as the database for storing and managing wall analysis jobs.  This replaces the in-memory storage previously used, enabling persistent storage and scalability.

## Changes

- Added Supabase client integration using the `supabase` Python library.
- Created a `.env.example` file to securely store Supabase URL and API keys.  **Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.**
- Updated the `/api/endpoints/walls.py` endpoint to use Supabase for job creation, retrieval, and updates.  The endpoint now supports listing jobs with optional filtering by status and pagination.
- Created a new `api/utils/db.py` module to encapsulate Supabase database interactions, providing functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and listing jobs.
- Updated `requirements-api.txt` to include `supabase` and `python-dotenv` dependencies.
- Added `test_supabase.py` to test the Supabase connection and basic database operations.


## Testing

Added unit tests (`test_supabase.py`) to verify the Supabase connection and basic database functionality.  The integration tests cover job creation, retrieval, updating, and listing.
