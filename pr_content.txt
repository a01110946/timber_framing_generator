PR TITLE: Add REST API for Timber Framing Generator

PR DESCRIPTION:
## Summary

This pull request introduces a REST API for the timber framing generator, enabling external applications to interact with the generator's functionality.  It includes a Docker configuration for easy deployment and API key authentication for security.

## Changes

- Added a FastAPI-based REST API with endpoints for wall analysis.
- Implemented asynchronous job processing for wall analysis using background tasks.
- Created models for API requests and responses using Pydantic.
- Developed a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy deployment.
- Added API key authentication for security.
- Implemented Rhino integration (conditional, based on environment variable).
- Created mock data and serialization utilities for testing.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include API dependencies.
- Added a new `requirements-api.txt` file to specify the API's dependencies separately.
- Modified `revit_walls.py` to adapt to changes made for API integration.


## Testing

The API includes unit tests and integration tests using pytest.  The Rhino integration is conditionally enabled through an environment variable (`USE_RHINO`).  When `USE_RHINO` is not set or set to "false", the API uses mock data for processing and testing purposes.  This facilitates testing without requiring a Rhino environment.
