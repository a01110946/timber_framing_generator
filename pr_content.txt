PR TITLE: Add Supabase Database Integration

PR DESCRIPTION:
## Summary

This pull request introduces integration with Supabase for persistent storage of wall analysis jobs.  This replaces the in-memory storage previously used, enabling scalability and persistence of job data.

## Changes

- Added Supabase database integration using the `supabase-py` library.  This includes a new `.env.example` file for configuring Supabase credentials.
- Modified the `/api/endpoints/walls.py` endpoint to use Supabase for creating, retrieving, updating, and listing jobs.  The endpoint now supports listing jobs with optional filtering by status and pagination.
- Created a new `api/utils/db.py` module to encapsulate Supabase database interactions. This module provides functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting jobs.
- Updated `requirements-api.txt` to include the `supabase` and `python-dotenv` packages.
- Added comprehensive unit tests (`test_supabase.py`) to verify the Supabase integration.


## Testing

The Supabase integration has been thoroughly tested using unit tests that verify database interactions, job creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions.  The tests also cover error handling scenarios.
