"""
Wall component module.

This module will contain wall-specific implementations:
- Wall data extraction from Revit
- Wall cell decomposition (WBC, OC, SC, SCC, HCC)
- Wall framing element types

Currently, wall functionality resides in:
- cell_decomposition/: Cell decomposition logic
- wall_data/: Revit data extraction
- framing_elements/: Element generators

This module serves as a placeholder for future migration of wall-specific
code into a component-based architecture.

# Future imports will go here when wall code is migrated
# from .wall_component import WallComponent
# from .wall_extractor import extract_wall_data
# from .wall_decomposer import decompose_wall
